# Bamazon.com
Welcome to Bamazon! This is an Amazon like store-front built using mySQL and Node.js

Within the customer portal, you can view available inventory, choose an item you'd like to purchase and voila! Tranction complete! However, if we do not have enough of the selected item, you'll be notified and the transaction will not go through. 

Within the manager portal, you can view all inventory in the store, view low inventory (where SOH < 5), add inventory back into stock or even add a new product to your inventory!

Happy shopping!
